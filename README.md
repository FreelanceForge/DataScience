we have deployed our mahine learning model.

As the project is about the rainfall prediction in australia. We have got set of features we did our data analysis through this we achived some important insights.

The we performed our feature engineering where we dealt with the nan values, most importantly outliers and dealt categorical variables by encoding.

We also applied the log normal distribution to standardize our continuous features.

As we have got alot of features so we did feature selection to select only those features which were very important.

We used RandomForest classifier and we achived 83 percent accuracy and most importantly we dealt with data leakage as well.
We also analyzed our predictions using appropriate metrics.

We also tried the artifical neuron network (ANN) where we achived 79 percent accuracy.

# Project :: Mobile Price Prediction System
## Project Description
Bob, the visionary founder of a burgeoning mobile company, recognizes the fierce competition in the market and understands the pivotal role data science plays in gaining a competitive edge. In an effort to strategically position his products, Bob has initiated a Mobile Price Prediction System. This sophisticated system analyzes diverse features of mobile phones to predict their price range, enabling Bob's company to offer competitive products against industry giants like Apple and Samsung
# Project Steps:
## 1) Data Collection:
Gather a comprehensive dataset containing diverse features of mobile phones, including specifications, features, and pricing information.

## 2) Data Exploration and Analysis:
Conduct in-depth data analysis using various visualization techniques such as ðŸ“Š pie charts, ðŸ“ˆ bar graphs, ðŸ“Š histograms, and ðŸ“Š box-whisker plots.
Uncover insights related to the correlation between mobile phone features and pricing.

## 3) Feature Engineering:
Apply rigorous feature engineering techniques to enhance the robustness of the dataset.
Incorporate log-normal distribution and address missing data points strategically.

## 4) Feature Selection:
Utilize correlation analysis to identify and retain the most influential features.
Streamline the dataset to optimize predictive accuracy by removing non-informative outliers.

## 5) Model Training:
Implement a RandomForestClassifier model for price range prediction.
Train the model on the curated dataset to achieve a high level of accuracy.

## 6) Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Analyze the model's effectiveness in categorizing mobile phones into distinct price ranges.
